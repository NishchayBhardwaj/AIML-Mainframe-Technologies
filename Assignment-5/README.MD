# COBOL KSDS Simulation using GNUCobol

This project demonstrates how to **simulate a VSAM KSDS (Key-Sequenced Data Set)** using **GNUCobol**. It replicates the behavior of inserting, displaying, and searching key-based records using a fixed-length flat file.

---

## üìù Problem Statement

Simulate a **VSAM KSDS** file structure with the following layout:

- **Key**: Customer ID (Columns 1‚Äì8)  
- **Data**: Customer Name (Columns 9‚Äì40), Address (Columns 41‚Äì100)

### COBOL Program Requirements

1. Insert **20 customer records** into a flat file (`customer_data.txt`) simulating a KSDS.
2. Display all records in **ascending order** based on **Customer ID**.
3. Allow the user to **search** for a specific Customer ID and display the record if found.

## üìÅ Files Structure

| File Name              | Description                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ksds_simulation.cbl`  | GNUCobol source file that simulates KSDS operations               |
| `customer_data.txt`    | Flat file storing fixed-length customer records                   |
| `README.md`            | Documentation and project overview                                |

## üí° Features Used

- **Fixed-length record formatting** to simulate column-based layout.
- **Manual sorting** of records based on Customer ID to replicate VSAM's key-sequenced behavior.
- **Sequential and conditional logic** for insert, display, and search operations.
- **GNUCobol** for compiling and executing COBOL code on non-mainframe environments.

---

## ‚úÖ Output Behavior

- On first execution, the program **inserts 20 sample records** into `customer_data.txt`.
- It then **displays all records** sorted by Customer ID.
- User is prompted to **enter a Customer ID** to search for, and the matching record (if found) is shown.

## üõ† How to Compile and Run

Ensure you have **GNUCobol** installed. Then follow these steps:

```bash
# Compile the COBOL program
cobc -x ksds_simulation.cbl -o ksds_simulation

# Run the executable
./ksds_simulation
